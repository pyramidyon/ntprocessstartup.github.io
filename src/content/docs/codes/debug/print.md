description: Debug print data on the 'blue screen' of windows.

When the native application is created by SMSS.exe, the boot sequence is halted which makes debugging our application difficult, but we have an screen which they call
'blue screen' which nowadays is actually a black screen. and that screen can display text and information without the use of a graphics driver / bootvid.dll
